# Day Planner (with JQuery)

## Description
  I created a simple day planner program using starter HTML and CSS code. I applied Bootstrap, JQuery, and Moment.js to the program to support the structure and styling, as well as functionality regarding the current time and date and color coding the time blocks. I learned how to dynamically create and modify HTML via JS functions and JQuery documentation.

## Installation & Usage

The planner lists each hour of the work day, has an input field for plans/events for each, and has a function to save and review the user's input when revisiting the page. The program color codes each hour based on whether it has passed, is the current hour, or is upcoming (in blue, red, or green respectively).
